## 🔧 **Current Status**

### ✅ Working:

- Payment links are live and functional
- Webhook server is running at `https://redforge.onrender.com`
- Stripe integration is complete

### ⚠️ Needs Attention:
- Custom domain `https://redforge.solvas.ai` returning 403 Forbidden
- GitHub Pages redirecting to custom domain but domain not serving content

## 🛠️ **To Fix Domain Issue**

### Option 1: Fix Custom Domain (Recommended)
1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Go to https://github.com/siwenwang0803/RedForge/settings/pages
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Ensure "Branch" is set to "main" and folder is "docs"
   - Verify custom domain is set to "redforge.solvas.ai"

2. **Purge Cloudflare Cache**:
   - Go to Cloudflare dashboard
   - Find redforge.solvas.ai domain
   - Go to "Caching" → "Purge Cache" → "Purge Everything"

3. **Check DNS Settings**:
   - Verify CNAME record: `redforge.solvas.ai` → `siwenwang0803.github.io`
   - May need to wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

### Option 2: Test Direct GitHub Pages
Try accessing: `https://siwenwang0803.github.io/RedForge/docs/`

## 🧪 **Test Payment Flow**

Once the site is accessible, test the complete flow:

1. **Visit Landing Page**
   - Check pricing section displays correctly
   - Verify payment buttons are functional

2. **Test Payment Links**:
   - **Starter Plan**: https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_b1TnUcNAlE848XM2OwrWZK4NG6eYsJvgKR9MUAlqizQw7lJJcYOBC8jWBQ
   - **Pro Plan**: https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_b1Xe4VSxiEXqflHBMIKgqSEp7tRtIrMNLsHQmq0Xv1OTGATAgjERx3ui5B

3. **Complete Payment Flow**:
   - Click payment button on landing page
   - Complete payment with real card
   - Check webhook receives event at Render
   - Run `redforge activate <email>` to activate account
   - Test unlimited scanning

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix domain access** (see options above)
2. **Test payment flow** end-to-end
3. **Monitor webhook logs** in Render dashboard
4. **Ready for production traffic!**

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**
